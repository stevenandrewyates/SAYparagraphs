# Stevens tips for paragraphs
I’m bad at writing: it’s true. So I read some books and put the information in this guide. If something is wrong, let me know.

The aim being when you have completed a paragraph, you work through this list.

## 1) Get the word count
Some people call reducing word count *murdering your darlings* or *cutting sentence flab*; either way, make every word count and sharpen the document by 10% to 20%. Let’s start by getting the word count and we will come back to it later. Got it? After working through this guide, hopefully, your word count will fall.
## 2) *Dear Reader*
Consider who you are writing for and what are the aims? The answer to the first question is the reader, and answer to the second question is clarity. We’ll cover these points later, but first close your eyes and pretend to be your mum or grandma. Now reread the first sentence, does it make sense? Would your mum understand it? I’m baffled by how many times *cows* become *ruminants*, *farms* become *agriculture* and *grass* becomes *grazing systems* (for example). Please, who are you trying to impress? Cut it out and use plain words.  

## 3) Subject coherence
Paragraphs all about something, so it makes sense the subject of every sentence is the same. Switching between subjects will give your *dear reader* a headache, as it is difficult to keep track of the subject. To check, highlight the subject of every sentence and make sure they match. In *Joe Moran’s* book, he offers this advice [here](https://www.amazon.com/First-You-Write-Sentence-Elements/dp/0241978491):

> Skilled writers make sentences cohere by starting with the same subject. If they are writing about *jaffa cakes*, then the subject of all the sentences will be *jaffa cakes*. They might mix it up a bit by using pronouns or pronounish words, so not to stat with every sentence with *jaffa cakes*. Or they might begin with a brief adverbial (surprisingly, *jaffa cakes* make good tea-dunkers) or a prepositional phrase (in size and shape, the *jaffa cake* is really a biscuit). 

This might be an opportunity to reduce the number of words by deleting sentences that aren't about your subject.

## 4) Untie nominalizations
*Yellowlees Douglas* best describes nominalisations: [here](https://www.amazon.com/Readers-Brain-Neuroscience-Better-Writer-ebook/dp/B00Y37ZA6K):

> Think of nominalizations as castrated verbs, sapped of their livelihood by serving nouns.

Likewise *Joe Moran* [says](https://www.amazon.com/First-You-Write-Sentence-Elements/dp/0241978491):

> A nominalisation makes a verb into a noun. It turns *act* into *action*, *react* into *reaction*, *interact* into *interaction*. A nominalisation implies that a process has stayed still long enough for us to name it. A nominalisations traps energy inside it, turning fluid actions into unmoving things. It is the white dwarf of a sentence. A nominalisation is the shrunken remains of a verbal clause, a noun heavy mass compacted with pre-learned knowledge. But pre-learned knowledge by whom? Your reader, you hope – but can’t be sure.

No writing advice I’ve read says anything positive about nominalisations, so change them into verbs. 

# 5) *Be* one less

Change one *be* verb into a vivid verb. Unfortunately, this does not mean simply substituting one word for another. While this means reworking the sentence, it will be worth the effort. [Here](https://www.wtps.org/cms/lib/NJ01912980/Centricity/Domain/1794/Vivid%20Verbs%201.pdf) is a list of vivid verbs I found online.

# 6) Tricolon

Tricolons are all about lists. I fell in love with them after reading [*The Elements of Eloquence*](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Eloquence-Perfect-English-Phrase-ebook/dp/B00KFEJN3Q) by *Mark Forsyth*. Read it. A tricolon is a series of three words, phrases or sentences that are parallel in structure, length and/or rhythm. The best examples are:
- *Veni*, *vidi*, *vici*
- Liberté, égalité, fraternité 
- [Sex, drugs and rock n roll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sex%2C%20drugs%2C%20and%20rock%20n%20roll)
- "I think we've all arrived at a very special place. Spiritually, ecumenically, grammatically." **Jack Sparrow** From *The Pirates of the Caribbean*.

In short, make all lists contain three items. In addition, they must be parallel in structure, which brings us onto the next point.

# 7) Parallel syntax

This is all about using repeated structure in your text. I found [this](https://www.evergreen.edu/sites/default/files/writingcenter/handouts/grammar/parallel.pdf) wonderful guide. It can also extend beyond a single sentence.  

# 8) *Of*

Back to [*Joe Moran*](https://www.amazon.com/First-You-Write-Sentence-Elements/dp/0241978491) for this one:
>Too many *ofs* in a long sentence means they are staple gunning nouns together with too few verbs. A word processing algorithm that spotted preposition overkill, especially one that rooted out all those *ofs*, would be better than any spellchecker. 

This is not to say that all *ofs* are bad, "*eight out* **of** *ten cats*" is perfectly acceptable. Which leads to *there is*.

# 9) *There is*
[*Yellowlees Douglas*](https://www.amazon.com/Readers-Brain-Neuroscience-Better-Writer-ebook/dp/B00Y37ZA6K) has this pet hate. 
>There is or adverb + [any form of be] is thoroughly lethal to readers’ comprehension. When you begin a sentence with *There is*, you turn the natural order of the sentence upside down.

Sounds like something that should be removed? Even the [*The Economist Style guide*]( https://www.amazon.com/Economist-Style-Guide-12th-ebook/dp/B01N9TXC27) agrees.
# 10 *We* pronouns

This really relates to *active* versus *passive* text. Should you say *we* or use *passive* tense? Perhaps the jury is out on this one. The journal **Nature** makes a clear [statement](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/for-authors/write) about it:

> Nature journals prefer authors to write in the active voice ("we performed the experiment...") as experience has shown that readers find concepts and results to be conveyed more clearly if written directly.

*We* is old hat and the best personal pronoun is *you*. *Steve Harrison* [explains](https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Better-Copy-Academy/dp/1509814574) that the best way to engage with a reader is by using *you*. In fact, he says for ad copy you should use *you* three times more than *we*. It's not just guys in advertising [*Helen Sword*](https://www.amazon.com/Stylish-Academic-Writing-Helen-Sword/dp/0674064488) says the same thing:

> One simple way to establish a bond with your reader is to employ the second-person pronoun you, either directly or by means of imperative verbs.

Likewise [*Helen Sword*](https://www.amazon.com/Stylish-Academic-Writing-Helen-Sword/dp/0674064488) recorded the percent of times articles used a personal pronoun and found most do.
Field|Percent articles with personal pronoun 
----------------|--------------
Medicine |92%
Evolutionary biology |100%
Computer science |82%

One word of caution, once I enthusiastically wrote in the active voice. My (kind) supervisor highlighted I had used *we* thirty-three times! It was plain to see that ***I*** should cut back (I told *you* I was bad at writing).

So, if someone insists on using passive (no *we*), let them know they are three steps behind. Otherwise *you* can make some shortcuts to slip them under the radar, like *suppose* or *consider*. Writing is all about engaging with your reader, which brings us to the next point.

## 10) Concrete *nouns*

Science is hard. A lot of science is abstract thinking (how does PCA work?), this means you need to spell things out. So, make sure each paragraph contains at least one concrete noun. For example, [*Steven Pinker*](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799) brings verbs to life here:

> Like fruit flies, regular and irregular verbs are small and easy to breed

[*Steven Pinker*](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799) goes further:

> A considerate writer will also cultivate the habit of adding a few words of explanation to common technical terms, as in “Arabidopsis, a flowering mustard plant” rather than the bare “Arabidopsis”

[*Helen Sword*](https://www.amazon.com/Stylish-Academic-Writing-Helen-Sword/dp/0674064488) has this to say:

>	Make sure at least one sentence per paragraph includes a concrete noun or a human activity, immediately follow it with and active verb

*You* may think this is hard. It isn't. Some of the best examples come from computer science: *port*, *mouse* and of course *window* (tricolon used intentionally). The point being a *concrete noun* helps conjure an image in the mind of your reader: which brings the subject to life.

## 11) Rhythm

Many of the books I've read make the same point about rhythm and say the best authors write a long sentence, then a short one, then a long one, then a short one, etc.

Having rhythm has many benefits. First consider a paragraph of just long sentences, this is hard work for the reader. Likewise, consider a paragraph of just short sentences, it will sound childish. Second, the structure helps a reader by making a long statement and then following up with a brief point. So vary sentence length. In case you're wondering, the following writing guide authors state this explicitly: [*Yellowlees Douglas*](https://www.amazon.com/Readers-Brain-Neuroscience-Better-Writer-ebook/dp/B00Y37ZA6K), [*Steve Harrison*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Better-Copy-Academy/dp/1509814574) and [*Joe Moran*](https://www.amazon.com/First-You-Write-Sentence-Elements/dp/0241978491).
## 12) Who kick's whom
It is easy for a sentence to get bogged down in clauses and hedges, the problem is it can be unclear *who kick's whom*. [*Helen Sword*](https://www.amazon.com/Stylish-Academic-Writing-Helen-Sword/dp/0674064488) is very keen on this and calls it smart sentencing:
- Concrete nouns and vivid verbs
- Keep the nouns and verbs close together
- Avoid weighing down sentences with clutter

And she advises:
> When an agent and action become separated by more than a dozen words readers quickly lose the plot.

Wheras [Anne Greene](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Science-English-Chicago-Publishing/dp/022602637X) says keep subjects and verbs no further than six or seven words apart. So, keep nouns and verbs together. A *one-two punch* is when the noun is followed by the verb e.g. *cats stink*. Double check that it is clear *Who kick's whom*
## 13) Sentence length
First off there is nothing wrong with a long sentence (there I said it). Normally  sentences are around 15-20 words; so as a rule I **chop sentences longer than forty words**. Often long sentences have too many clauses or modifiers in them and it is difficult to see *who kick's whom*. If your sentence is growing longer, check for *parallel syntax*. The other problem in sentences are too many clauses, like below.  
## 14) Conjunctions

Conjunctions are excellent for joining sentences and inserting *clauses* and *sub-clauses* in sentences. But not all conjunctions are equal. If you want a *clause* to have equal weight you should use one of the **FANBOYS** as described by [*June Casagrande*](https://www.amazon.com/Was-Best-Sentences-Worst-Crafting/dp/158008740X). They are:

- **FANBOYS**
- **F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et and **S**o
 

Everything else is a subordinating conjunction. Which means what follows has a lower grammatical status. Although nothing is wrong with relegating something to lower status, like some extra information or asides. The problem is when important or exciting information is relegated to a lower grammatical status. [*June Casagrande*](https://www.amazon.com/Was-Best-Sentences-Worst-Crafting/dp/158008740X) gives this example

> Before robbing a bank, Mike was an accountant

The problem is the interesting part, *robbing a bank*, is given lower status, because of the *before* conjunction (not a FANBOYS). She offers this alternative:

> After working for twenty-five years as an accountant, Mike robbed a bank.

See the difference? She also points out the funny thing about subordinating conjunctions, look at this sentence:

> Steven likes Big-Macs

now add a word:

> Because Steven likes Big-Macs ...
> If Steven likes Big-Macs ...
> Although Steven likes Big-Macs ... etc.

The addition of a subordinating conjunction has rendered the sentence incomplete. Meaning they (subordinating conjunctions) are less important and the reader knows this.

One final point, *and* is the weakest **FANBOYS** because it specifies a link but not what sort. Instead think if another ** FANBOYS** would be better in its' place.

Take home message check your conjunctions, check your **FANBOYS**.
## 15) Negate me not

Avoid negation. For example, instead of *we did not find* use *we failed to find*. Negation is funny because it changes the thing it acts upon, thus requiring a bit of work by the reader. So, spare the reader the hassle. 

One thing that must never be used is double negation. Consider:
> He ***never*** says nothing interesting to ***no*** one.

What does this mean? A reword would help.
> He ***never*** says anything interesting to anyone.

Double negatives work in speech because of intonation, but they don't work in writing so weed them out.

Here are some *affirmative* words to replace those *negative* words, from [Anne Greene](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Science-English-Chicago-Publishing/dp/022602637X) & [*Yellowlees Douglas*](https://www.amazon.com/Readers-Brain-Neuroscience-Better-Writer-ebook/dp/B00Y37ZA6K).

*Negative* | *Affirmative*
----------|-----------
did not accept| rejected
did not consider | ignored
does not have| lacks
did not allow| prevented
not the same| different
not possible| impossible
not many| few
did not| failed to
not necessary | unnecessary
not certain| uncertain


## 16) Plural Plurals

Plurals can become tricky, especially when there are many of them. So double and triple check when you have plurals in a sentence. 
[Gyles Brandreth]( https://www.amazon.com/Have-Eaten-Grandma-Gyles-Brandreth/dp/0241352630) has nine rules for plurals, they are:
- Subjects and verbs must agree in number:
-- The *summer* **is** hot
-- The *summers* **were** hot
- Words between subjects and verbs don’t affect them:
-- The *girl*, wearing several layers, **is** hot
- If two subjects are joined “and” they require a plural verb:
-- The *girl* and the *boy* **are** getting carried away
- The verb remains singular if the two subjects separated by “and” refer to the same thing:
-- *Fish* and *chips* **is** my favourite treat
- If one of the words “each”, “every”, or “no” comes before the subject, the verb is singular:
--Each *person* **is expected** to behave properly
- If the subjects are both singular and are connected by the words “or”, “nor”, “neither/nor”, “either/or”, or “not only/but also” the verb is singular:
-- Neither *Adam" nor *Eve* **is** responsible for what happened next, nor **is** the *apple* or the *snake*
- If one subject is singular and the other plural and the words are connected by the words “or”, “nor”, “neither/nor” “either/or”, or “not only/but also” the verb form of the subject that is closest:
-- Either the *apples* or the *serpent* **is** responsible for what's happened
-- Neither the *serpent* or the *apples* **have** been seen since
- Indefinite pronouns typically take singular form:
-- *Everybody* **wants** to be understood
-Collective nouns like “government”, ”team”, “flock”, “crowd”, “company” usually take singular form
-- The *crowd* **is getting** restless
-- The *team* **sucks**

## 17) *even more* Tautology
Tautology and double modifiers basically say the same thing twice. The antidote to this to remove one. Here are some double modifiers I found in a recent paper:
- *considerably increases*
- *exceptionally longer*
- *dramatically increased*
- *even more*
- *much larger*
-- In all cases the first word can be removed

Find some tautology examples, taken from [here](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/tautology.htm) below:
- At that *moment in time*, the stars dimmed. *(It's always a **moment** in **time**)*
- The man who used to live next door is a *single bachelor*. *(**Bachelors** are always **single**)*
- The vote was *totally unanimous*. *(The word **totally** doesn't add anything)*
- He was in a *three-way* love *triangle*. *(The word **three-way** doesn't add up to anything else)*
- He left at *3 am in the morning*. *(The term **am** means in the morning.)*
- The *reason is because* he left during the dinner. *(The word **because** doesn't add anything)*
- In *our assessment, we think* he is alive.*(**In our assessment** and **we think** do the same job)*
- This is a *new innovation*. *(**Innovations** are always **new**)*
 

[*Joe Moran*](https://www.amazon.com/First-You-Write-Sentence-Elements/dp/0241978491) also hates what he calls *sentence flab*:
> Solution, unspool the nouns strings. Turn weak verb-noun phrases into verbs. Puts emphasis on: emphasizes. Gives the impression: suggests. Draws attention to, notes. Tying noun phrases together with weak verbal knots is simple. Adding strong verbs is hard. Nouny sentences are a labour to read and a breeze to write. Those who write them assume that, just by gumming nouns together, they have communicated with other human beings. All they have achieved is lazy, bogus fluency.

while we're here I'll add these from [Janice Matthews and Robert Matthews](https://www.amazon.com/Successful-Scientific-Writing-Step-Step/dp/0521699274)

*instead of*| *use*
----------------|---------------
at this point in time |now
due to the fact that |because
employ, utilize |use
high degree of accuracy |accurate

in the event that |if
method |way
neonate |newborn
oftentimes |often
plethora |excess
postoperatively |after surgery
prior to |before
retard |slow
sacrifice, euthanatize |humanely kill or destroy
subsequent to |after
## 18) Forbidden words
Some words are just ugly, below is a selection from the [*The Economist Style guide*]( https://www.amazon.com/Economist-Style-Guide-12th-ebook/dp/B01N9TXC27):
- *Address* meaning *answer*, *deal with*, *attend to*, *look at*
- *Facilitate*
- *Famously*
- *Focus*
- *Impact* meaning *affect*
- *Innovative*
- *Likely* meaning *probably*
- *Looking to* meaning *intending to*
- *Meaningful*
- *Paradigm*
- *Participate* in use *take part in*

And some from [Gyles Brandreth]( https://www.amazon.com/Have-Eaten-Grandma-Gyles-Brandreth/dp/0241352630):
- *Going forward* try *in the future*
- *Upcoming* try *forthcoming*
- *Forward planning* try *planning*
- *Pre-planned* try *planned*
- *Pushback* try *resist*
- *Factor in* try *include*
- *Irregardless* try *regardless*
- *At this moment in time* try *now*


## 19) Numbers

Three rules about numbers:
- Never start a sentence a number, if you must spell them out *twenty-three*
- Numbers below twenty are written (the rule varies between people, but this is my rule: they're all one word)
- Commas separate thousands, so **1,000** not 1`000.

## 20) Acronyms

Three rules for acronyms:
- Only use an acronym if it is used more than five times. 
- Never start a sentence with an acronym (spell it out). 
- Never use one in a title. Except the well known ones (*DNA*).

## 21) If you can cut, do.
Orwell advised:
> If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out

Or: 
> *If you can cut a word, do*

Furthermore, it's not about just cutting words it's about cutting syllables. You know the score

Now go back to point **1** and see how many words you've cut and keep cutting to reduce the paragraph by 10-20%.

## 22) Final thoughts

Ok this isn't all. But here are a few things before sending the document out. First have you *italicised* all the *Latin* and *foreign* names? Believe me, this will annoy the hell out of the reader. After decrying being *sick of the document* and *unable to read it anymore*; nothing is worse than not italicising things. The reason is once this slip-up is found the reader thinks what else didn't they *bother* to do... Also be consistent with acronyms, again jumping between acronyms and not-acronym, just looks careless. Personally I recommend using the search function for all cases mentioned above (search for *et al.,**).

You will spare yourself many blushes by simply reading the document aloud. I know it is cheesy, but really do it. Otherwise take some advice from Joe Moran and change the font and change the font size (at least **three** times). Then reread the document, this will give you a new pair of eyes. I use an [online](https://prowritingaid.com/Premium)  editor, for which there is a free version. Others are available like the [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) (personally I dislike books by Hemmingway, so sue me). The main point is having something else to visualise your work gives you a fresh take. Besides these another tried and tested method is getting someone else to read it for you. However, this is often difficult; but persistence and beer can help to persuade someone else.

In this guide (now) I have tried to include as much as possible and give credit where due (please don't sue me). But it isn't everything, there is more like: *verb-less* sentences (don't), hedging words (don't) and glue index. But that’s all for now. Check back, maybe things will be added or removed. Maybe, just maybe there is a tool to help (it is GitHub after all).  

## Book club
I’ve mentioned quite a few books, most were a joy to read. The authors are often witty and self-deprecating (important for an English reader). To finish a tricolon of tricolons of books

-	Essential reading
o	*The Elements of Style* by **William Strunk**, is nearly one-hundred years old and is the best book. The reason being it is so short. It is a breeze to read and packed full of no non-sense help. Seriously read this book first.
o	*Writing Science in Plain English* by **Anne Greene**, is also short and to the point. I think reading this would help anyone. 
o	*It Was the Best of Sentences, It Was the Worst of Sentences* by **June Casagrande**, is number three on my list. This book is all about grammar but presented in a beautiful way. It doesn’t preach or give boring rules. June gives advice based on her experience which is very practical.
-	Fun, Fresh and Frankly brilliant
o	*The Elements of Eloquence* by **Mark Forsyth**, the dark arts of rhetoric. It’s seriously good. Not all of it useful for scientific writing but all of it is a joy to read. In fact, any book by Mark is worth reading.
o	*How Write Better Copy Academy* by **Steve Harrison**, the dark art of advertising. I read this because Joe Moran suggested it. It’s an excellent read because it’s from a different perspective and Steve seriously knows how to write.
o	*Have You Eaten Grandma* by Giles **Brandreth**, it’s fun and gives excellent advice on grammar.
-	The good, the bad and the ugly
o	*First You Write Sentence* by **Joe Moran** an ode to the sentence. I found myself rereading sections many times to see the wonders of what was explained. One word of caution I recommended this book to some non-native English speakers and they struggled with it. But it is worth the effort.
o	*The Economist Stye guide* the what’s what of style. This is gives clear dos and don’ts for writing along with many helpful tips. I’ve used this as a reference many times.
o	*The Sense of Style* by **Steven Pinker**, a modern version of *The Elements of Style*. There’s a lot I like about this book, like the tips and style. I just wish it was shorter (more Strunk like)…
